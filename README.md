# :muscle: E1RM Application
A small vanilla Typescript application built with Material components to calculate an estimated one rep max.

Two types of formulas are used in the application. If an RPE is provided, Mike Tucherer's formula is used, otherwise Brzyckis' formula is used.

## Personal Comments
I wanted to create a small application using simple Typescript to get a better feel of the language. Material components were also used as I wanted to be more familiar with using them in the future. I'm expecting to use them a lot more in larger personal apps.

I'm happy with how it came out and I will definitely be using this personally at the gym to help with estimations in my own gym programming.
